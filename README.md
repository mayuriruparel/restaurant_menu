Restaurant Menu Application developed in Flutter for Flutter Create.

For Displaying Categories - Horizontal List View is used and based on the index alternate paddng is given so as to provide alternate up and down cards. Cards are further given rounded rectangle shape.
For Displaying Food Items - Page View is used (I just wanted to use another element other than horizantal list view), Images, Item Name and Price are displayed accordingly. 
Data: All the data in the Application comes from i.json file in assets folder
Images: Images used in this app are located in assets/img folder. 
All images used are free stock photos from https://www.pexels.com/ and here is its licence link: https://www.pexels.com/photo-license/
Fonts: Google Font 'VarelaRound' are used in this Application. 
Fonts and Images specified in pubspec.yaml

There are no any other third party plugins or library used. Its just a plan dart code and everything is inside main.dart 

There is no special configuration required to run this App as the assets and fonts are inside this zip, Command "flutter run" should be able to run on the devices connected. I have tested on Honor Play Android Phone & iPhone7 works very well.

I will be uploading this project 's Source code and will be available on Github with MIT Licence:
